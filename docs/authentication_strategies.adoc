= Authentication Strategies

This application supports different authentication strategies:

== Ldap and Local DB authentication strategy

Implemented in LdapAndLocalDbAuthConfig.java.

=== Behavior

Authenticates the user via Ldap by default. If the username is not associated to an LDAP account,
they are authenticated against a username and password stored in the relational database.

=== To enable

This is the default authentication strategy and is enabled when Keycloak authentication is disabled.

You must provide a Spring Boot LDAP config:

Example:
----
include::../src/main/resources/ldap.example.yml[]
----

== Keycloak authentication strategy

Implemented in KeycloakAuthConfig.java.

=== Behavior

Authenticates the user against an external Keycloak instance.

=== To enable

You must provide a Spring Boot Keycloak client config:

Example:
----
include::../src/main/resources/keycloak.example.yml[]
----
