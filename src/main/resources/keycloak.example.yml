# This file is an example of a connection config for a Keycloak instance that is easy to set up.
# For this example config to work, your Keycloak instance should:
# - Have a "realm" called "seqdb-realm".
# - Be available at the "auth-server-url" (You can change this).
# - Have a public access "client" called "seqdb"

# More config options at:
# https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_java_adapter_config
# (This yml file uses the same properties as the JSON config.)
