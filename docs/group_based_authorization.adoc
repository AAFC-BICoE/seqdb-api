= Group-based Authorization

This application performs authorization using a Group system.

== Entities

These are the JPA entities involved in authorization:

=== Accounts

The user account with account name, API key, account expiration date, last login, etc.

A new Account is created for a user the first time they log in using LDAP or Keycloak.

=== People

More detail about specific people (First/Last/Middle name). An Account links to a People record
(The owner of the Account).

=== Groups

A group of users who share data. Many of the records in SeqDB link to a Group, meaning that record
belongs to that Group. A user must have read permission on a group in order to see the data
belonging to that group. Same with write/create/delete permissions, the user must have the correct
permission on a Group to perform that operation on a Group's data.

An Account has an "AccountType‚Äù, it is either "User" or "Admin", which is the user's role for the
entire application. Admin accounts are treated as if they have all permissions on every group, so
certain listing pages will show you all records, even from Groups you're not a member of.

=== AccountsGroup

aka "User Permissions". These are linking records between Accounts and Groups. Each AccountsGroups
record states a user's set of permissions for the linked Group. A user can have separate permissions
for read, write, delete, create. A user can be an "admin" of a group, meaning they are allowed to
add/remove/edit other users' permissions for that group.

Admin status on a group is separate from admin status on the entire application.

== API authorization behavior

The REST API implements group-based authorization for read and write operations:

=== Requesting one resource by ID

When requesting a resource by ID, the API will return a 403 forbidden error when the user does not
have read access to that resource's Group.

=== Listing resources

When listing resources, the API will automatically filter teh data to only show records belonging
to Groups where the user has read permission.

=== Creating, updating or deleting resources

To perform any of these write operations, the user must have the appropriate create, update or
delete permission for that resource's Group. WHen the user does not have the appropriate permission,
they will get a 403 Forbidden error.
