# Example config file to use a SelfSigned certificate for testing.
#
# You need to generate the certificate using keytool, which is included in the JDK:
# keytool -genkey -alias tomcatssl -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore keystore.jks -validity 3650
#
# This will generate "keystore.jks", which you can put in src/main/resources to link to it in this
# file using "classpath:keystore.jks"
#
# This example is taken from:
# http://code-adda.com/2018/06/07/enable-https-with-self-signed-certificate-in-spring-boot/

server:
  ssl:
    key-store: classpath:keystore.jks
    key-store-password: qwerty
    keyStoreType: JKS
    keyAlias: tomcatssl
